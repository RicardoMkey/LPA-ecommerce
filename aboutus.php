      Early, LPA was only a physic store without website and database system, due to the pandemic, the sales had been affected significantly. 
      Besides, records the information manually using file system was been elaminated in this advanced age. 
      Therefore, LPA adopted the system from manual system to online system which is a web application system.
      However, LPA also reserved the old method of selling, which is selling at store, so the customers have two choices to purchase our product.
